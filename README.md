# Gemini Game Engine

##Introduction

Gemini is a Two-Dimensional C++ Game Engine written in C++. It uses OpenGL, more specifically GLEW and GLFW to render graphics.
The engine has rotational box hit detection physics based on the Separating Axis Theorem.

##Future Goals

Integrating an Audio Engine into Gemini is the next step using OpenAL.
Parts of the audio library are deprecated, so parsing audio files will need to be done manually.

Other future goals include: Powerup System, Text Rendering
